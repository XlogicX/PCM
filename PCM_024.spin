••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  Description ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
This is a 16-bit, 4-channel, sample based audio driver.
Meant to be used at 80 Mhz

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx     Usage    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You will be using the higher level API call of PlayNote.
It takes input of what Channel, frequency/note, volume, bit quality, garbledness, ors, duration, and sample / waveshape you will want to play

This is the format: PlayNote (chan, pitch, vol, Wqual, garb, dur, waveshape)

-chan can take values 1, 2, 3, and 4
-The pitch field starts at 1; the highest frequency. The larger this number gets, the lower the pitch will be
-the vol field starts at 0, the loudest. 1 is half as loud, 2 is half that, and so on. Although more precision could be desired,
 I prefer the low clock usage of a simple right shift, instead of complicated division; clocks eat at my higher frequencies.
-the quality field starts at 0 for the highest quality. The lowest quality goes up to 29, it is basically a square wave at 1-bit
 quality. For this very reason, I will probably not include a sample for a square wave; it's just pointless.
-the duration field is used for how long to play the note, the larger the value, the longer the note will be played
-the waveshape field allows you to pick a sample. The first sample in the data area would be number 1, the next number 2, and so
 on.
-the garble field, uhh, I don't know, it garbles the sound up a little.
-the ors field applies a user specified OR mask to audio

Sample data format:
-Each sample is made up of 128 16-bit (2 byte) values.
-You will notice that they are in the format of $XXXX_XXXX, ...
-There are actually 64 of those separated by commas, each one includes 2 16 bit samples
-The decompression engine sorts that all out automatically.
  Tenor and Alto waves: Don't expect to get above 1khz with the 128 piece samples using my code...I know, :(. However, a hack for
  that is samples that have the same wave shape with less pieces packed a few times into the sample
        -Waves that end in _tenor have the named waveshape repeat twice (so it would be 64 pieces two times)
        -Waves that end in _alto have the named waveshape repeat three times (so it would be about 43 pieces 3 times)

Explanation for gratuitous Note CON section:
As you can see, I have conversions for bass, tenor, alto, and soprano notes. There are pros and cons for which you decide to use
-On the Bass end:
  Pro: This is where the sound has the most 'piece' resloution, it has 128 pieces of data per shape, which means it has the
       least sub-harmonics. This is most noticeable in a low frequency sine wave
  Con: Limited upper range; you can't get any higher than 2,982 Hz
  Con: Precision is reduced; an A note in the 3rd octave is 220Hz, however, the closest value the bass values can play is 213Hz
-On the soprano end:
  Pro: Great upper range; highest pitch is 23,860Hz.
  Pro: Precision is also great compared to bass end; the 220Hz A note is executed as 220.93.
  Con: Greatly reduced piece quality; there would only be 16 pieces/values for each shape
-Discussion: Does any of this matter? Kind of, but not greatly. If you want notes in an upper range and for them to be in tune,
 then go with soprano. It's actually harder to hear degraded audio at higher notes anyway (I tested this). If you need really
 low bassy notes to sound clear without subharmonics, you will want to opt for the bass and tenor samples. The quality is most
 notable in smoother/slower changing wave shapes though, such as sine and triangle. On the other end, if your using square
 waves, I don't see a reason not to use soprano for all of the notes. Another note to make is that the notes do tend to get
 out of tune the higher the notes get (for any of the range of samples).
-Columns commented in CON section: I have a column for what the actual frequency of the note should be. A column for what
 frequency the driver is actually playing, and another column of "tolerance" showing a ratio of how close they are in
 relation. Anything in the thousandth digit and even hundredth digit is probably fine to an extent, but I wouldn't recommend
 using the notes that have values in the tenth digit, unless you want your music to sound horrible.

***************************************************   Change History   ***********************************************************

Ver 0.1 [August '09]:
  •This is an example of simple PWM, duty cycle is 2/3 on, hard coded
Ver 0.2 [August '09]:
  •added the ability to change duty cycle, resolution of 16
Ver 0.3 [August '09]:
  •made analog (PWM) assembly code independent. Think of it as a DAC on a cog
Ver 0.4 [August '09]:
  •Added PCM portion of assembly code, it's very basic; it just goes through and outputs each voltage listed in the index.
  →Would like to clean up some of the looping in the PWM code, since I just found out about DJNZ.
Ver 0.4.5 [August '09]:
  •Used DJNZ jumps in PWM code.
  •Cleaned up comments and formatting.
  •Removed delay from VAR and PUB and passing to PWM, changed it to hard coded, as it should not change in run-time.
  →I next need to re-add a delay to VAR, but this time to pass to PCM, this delay will be used to change the frequency of the wave.
Ver 0.5 [9-3-2009]:
  •Had to re-write everything when I found out about crta and frqa; it does PWM for me, seamlessly. The main assembly code now
   does PCM, successfully.
Ver 0.6 [9-3-2009]:
  •I decided to go from 8-bit with 64 samples to 16-bit with 128 samples. I even tried as much detail as 32-bit with 256 samples,
   though it made a small difference, it wouldn't justify the 1k per sample cost. The current sampling method uses 256 bytes per
   sample (previous method used 64 bytes). 8-bit with 64 samples had too many higher frequency harmonics when generating lower
   frequencies, 16-bit at 128 samples reduced this problem significantly.
Ver 0.7 [9-4-2009]:
  •Now has two wave types in library (Sine and Saw).
  •Also added the ability to pass a frequency value through the spin API.
Ver 0.8 [9-4-2009]:
  •I guess it's bad to have 16-bit audio samples stored in 32 bit long data (it wastes double the space). Added code to take a
   long with 2 16-bit samples and split them up.
  •Had to do some clock cycle balancing using quite a bit of nop's. I may squeeze extra instructions in there instead if needed.
  •Doing this meant that I had to reformat my data index for the Sine and Saw waves as well.
  •I also visually reformatted it with underscores to separate the words and fitting each wave's data into the screen by
   wrapping (instead of all of the data trailing off far to the right).
Ver 0.9 [9-4-2009]:
  •Added Volume and Quality shifting to spin API. Volume calculations are simple so far; they use a shift right instruction.
   The effect is halving the volume by each value higher. quality allows you to change the bit quality on the fly; you could
   play a sample at 16-bit and flip it to 5-bit quality just for fun.
Ver 1.0 [9-04-2009]:
  •Yay, the big 1.0. This version adds a duration to the sample. Larger the value, the longer it plays.
  •Also renamed program to PCM instead of PWM
Ver 1.1 [9-05-2009]:
  •Put wave tables in main memory as a DAT section right after CON section (starting at 0x18).
  •Wrote a loading routine in ASM that takes wave from main memory and puts it in a local wave sample in cog memory. It takes
   27.72 microseconds from initialization to hearing sound start (not bad).
Ver 1.2 [9-05-2009]:
  •Added the ability to select what wave shape to play. 1 is the smallest number to pick from. init time is now 41.25
   microseconds.
  •Also added triangle and hump shape.
Ver 1.3a [9-09-2009]:
  •Tested passing more values to ASM, for 2 channels
Ver 1.3b [9-10-2009]:
  •Played with dividing channels for a mixer (into fractions)
Ver 1.3c [9-10-2009]:
  •Added variables for 4 channels, combines all for channels in the mixer
  •updated 1/3 fraction to 5/16 (instead of 3/8).
Ver 1.3d [9-10-2009]:
  •Cleaned out unused code and added comments. Verified in GEAR that data was moving as it should. I am going to have to flex
   multiple cores at this point.
Ver 1.3e [9-11-2009]:
  •Created a working decompression engine. You can select which channels you want decompressed, the engine will take the shapes
   for each channel (from shapes currently defined in spin) and decompresses them into main memory. It also does not waste time
   decompressing all of the channels; it only decompresses the ones you tell it to.
  •Also recleaned code; got rid of unused variables for the DeCom engine, added documentation comments.
Ver 1.3f [9-17-2009]:
  •Fixed bugs with DeCom engine. The engine should no longer need to be modified, it does what it needs to
Ver 1.3g [9-18-2009]:
  •Created Mixer engine, it only mixes for now, no special effects.
Ver 1.4 [9-18-2009 to 9-19-2009]:
  •Created PCM engine, works, has some glitches though.
Ver 1.4b [9-23-2009]:
  •Fixed indexing glitch in PCM, it was indexing 1 value too far in the wave shape tables
Ver 1.4c [9-24-2009 to 9-26-2009]
  •Fixed object glitch, memory table would get thrown down a 32-bit word when adding an OBJ, changed some of the hard coded
   addresses to fix this. Added a 'silence' wave shape
Ver 1.4d [9-26-2009]:
  •Wrote some high level code to re-test everything, to make sure it all works before moving on.
Ver 1.5 [9-26-2009]:
  •Added volume and quality back in. Made quality apply to mixed value, instead of individual channels. It's a small sacrifice,
   but still cool enough of an effect on the whole output, and it saves more clock cycles for the Mixer Engine.
Ver 1.5b [10-03-2009]:
  •Attempted to fix the volume and quality, since it didn't work, as I expected, I'm getting tired of crap not working.
  •There were a couple of hard coded addresses I forgot to change.
  •Also, the mixer engine was offsetting some of the cog variables instead of the main memory reference to the values in
   initialization (forgot to add the _adr at the end of them).
Ver 1.6 [10-03-2009]:
  •Bugs fixed and verified from Version 1.5b. I had to use shl instead of shr for the quality effect. shl looked really
   interesting on the O-Scope, I will have to 'listen' to it later to see what that sounds like. Although it has a side effect
   of halfing volume, but that would have an easy fix as well.                 
Ver 1.7 [10-03-2009]:
  •Added API. Now have high level function such as PlayNote.
Ver 1.8 [10-09-2009]:
  •Made code self suficient; it can be used as an object in other code. I did this by finally removing the hard
   coded references to the channel and wave data.
  •I also made the audio pin number configurable. I used to have it hard coded to pin 31 (becuase it's cool to hear the chip
   get programmed!)
Ver 1.9 [10-16-2009]:
  •Evened pitches on all channels via a silent wave burst on all channels on driver startup
  •Also make a CON section for musial note mnemonics
Ver 2.0 [10-17-2009]:
  •Made duration parameter consistent; a duration of '100' will play just as long for an E note as a B note (this was not
   previously the case :(     
  •Made the duration resolution configurable in object startup.
  •Added a tenor, alto, and soprano version of the saw wave
Ver 2.1 [10-17-2009]:
  •Added two effects; garble, and an OR mask
Ver 2.2 [10-21-2009]:
  •Added bass, tenor, alto, and soprano versions of noise wave
  •Added alto and soprano versions of sine wave
  •Added bass, tenor, alto, and soprano versions of square wave. I know, I know, I finally broke down and added these. I did
   this to support higher level functions like DownNote that don't take quality as a parameter.
  •Added DownNote function, documentation is included in function
  •Added UpNote function, documentation is included in function  
Ver 2.3 [10-22-2009]:
  •Added MeshNotes, MashNotes, Wiggle, and Split functions
Ver 2.4 [10-24-2009]:
  •Updated CON table to exploit redundancies in the notes.

→Anything that pops in my head, I'm pretty satisfied with the driver for now.

                                            **********************************
--------------------------------------------* Decompression Assembly Engine: *------------------------------------------------------
                                            **********************************
                                            
Function:     This engine will request which channels you want decompressed, will check the shape to decompress, and will store the
              Decompressed wave in main memory.
How it works: 1. The engine grabs the memory locations for the shape selected for each channel, it also gets address of the flags
              2. Engine enters main loop.
                        -Are there any requests to decompress (are any flags set)?
                                (no)>  check again until there is
                                (yes)> if there is a request for channel 1
                                                ->get shape for channel 1 from memory
                                                ->decompress it
                                                ->store it back to main memory
                                       ...
                                       ...
                                       do this for all for channels
                                reset flags to 0
                                go back to beginning of loop, waiting for another cog to set some flags
Flag register: The flag register is only 4 bits (nibble). They are arranged as: Ch4, Ch3, Ch2, Ch1
                        Example 1: Flag is set to $7 (0111), this means the engine will process ch1, ch2, and ch3
                        Example 2: Flag is set to $A (1010), this means the engine will process ch2 and ch4          
Shape vars   : These 4 variables from spin (shape, shape2, shape3, shape4) get passed to the engine as (asmshape, asmshape2,
                        asmshape3, asmshape4).
                        If I wanted a 'hump' wave on channel 3, I would have to set shape3 to '4' (or whatever number in
                        the wave index it would be in), and I would have to set the flag to x1xx (where the value of the x
                        bits don't matter).
Additional
Note          : It is important to set the shape before flagging (with a delay after setting the shape). If you flagged,
                        the engine may run with the old shape before the other cog would get to the next instruction of
                        changing the shape

--------------------------------------------*          Mixer Engine:         *------------------------------------------------------
                                            **********************************
                                            
Function:     This engine will take the 4 samples to mix (as an address of each), mixt them, add effects, then put the output on
              a shared address for consumption by PCM engine.
How it works:
Notes:        -Continiously runs (without being called); expect the output address to hold a semi up to date mix of values in the
              channel addresses in real time.
              -The addressess that hold another address that hold the value sounds confusing, and I shouldn't just leave it at
              lol'ing at it in the comments below. The indirectness allows me to be flexible. This engine merely asks where the
              real data is located, instead of all of the extra overhead of passing several real values everywhere. Other cores
              are going to be constantly updating the data in real time, so this engine only cares where that data currently is,
              and will then play with it. Visuall analogy (painful):
                        Addresses               value in address
                        1337 W. HaK Dr.         Actual Sample chunk of data     (a value)
                        1369 E. Noob St.        1337 W. HaK Dr.                 (a value, however, of an address)

                        This code grabs the address of the address (it gets the 1369 address),
                        It puts the value of that address (1337 Dr.) in a local variable,
                        It then overwrites the value of the address from that local variable (1337 Dr.) into the variable.
                        So now we have real data in a local workable variable (inderectly, but flexibly)
                        ...lol

Function:     This engine keeps track of where the signal level of each channel should be in time. It first goes through a check
              through each channel to decide the level, while placing those levels in the mixer data. The engine next takes the
              mixer output and throws it on the PWM engine (a part of this engine)
How it works: For any wave you want to play, you must set done flags to 0 from SPIN.
Notes:
