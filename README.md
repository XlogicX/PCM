PCM
===

This is a project I worked on from August of 2009 to October 24 2009. I plan to pick it back up at some point, since I had already invested so much into it.

This is an audio driver for the Propeller microcontroller, most of it is written in assembly, the high level code for the API is written in Spin.

The other details are in the documentation part of the source code for now.
